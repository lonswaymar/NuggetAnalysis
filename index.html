    <p>The National Basketball Association is the second highest revenue sports leauge in the world. Moreover, the league has players representing a record 43 different countries. In fact, during the past five years, the athletes voted to win the most valuable player (MVP) represent Serbia, Cameroon, and Greece, respectively. With global reach and a diverse player base, the NBA produces entertainment that spans continents. Because analysts meticulously record player and game statistics, game data is ripe for hobbiest data scientists to explore the patterns of their favorite players and teams. Analyzing this data may yield understanding to many facets of basketball, such as why some teams have greater success than others, or what types of plays a player can make to be most impactful. This analysis will start off by looking at the general life cycle of an NBA athelete and uncover league averages in contributions such as points, assists, and rebounds.</p>
    <p>The analysis herein will focus mainly on what stats the most reputable athletes generate. Particularly, this analysis will look at two former MVPs, Nikola Jokic and Russell Westbrook, that currently play on the same team: the Denver Nuggets. Aged 30 and 36 respectively, the two athletes are at different points in their career trajectory, with the latter far beyond the average age of retirement for the NBA. However, both athletes have shown great success throughout their entire careers and we will examine what qualities of their play have lead to such great achievement. However, achievement was never gauranteed. And many fans, particularly for Russell Westbrook, were quick to decry his slumping contributions in during the later half of his career. Were these criticisms justified? Or were they frustrated pieces of gossip garnered on social media by fans of a losing team? This analysis will look to ask: </p>
    <p>1-3) How can we quantify the average NBA player? How many points do they score or assists do they make? How many years do they play?</p>
    <p>4-5) Are there performance indicators that suggest when a player will retire? What indicates a long career?</p>
    <p>6) How great are Jokic and Westbrook to the averages?</p>
    <p>7) In what ways are these two athletes the greatest and why did they deserve MVP nomination?
    <p>8) Have they elevated each others game? How is Russ in Denver?</p>
    <p>9) What is the news sentiment around each player? Do they differ in positivity?</p>
    <p>10) and lastly... is there any possible way to predict the outcome of a game?</p>

    <p>
        <strong>One place to begin understanding NBA data,</strong> is to know the three main statistics that our two famed athletes are most famous for: points, rebounds and assists. 
        In the following figures, you'll see these statistics abbreviated to "PTS", "REB", and "AST", respectively.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Points occur when a player throws the ball into a basketball hoop. They can be scored in increments of one, two, or three.
            <li> Assits occur when a player passes the ball to another player, and the secondary player immediately moves to score. The assist is awarded to the first player.
            <li> Rebounds occur when a player grabs a ball that has just been thrown towards a basket and misses. They occur offensively, when a player catches the ball off of the opponent's goal, and defensively, when the ball is caught rebounding off the player's own goal.
        </ul>
    
    <p>
        An athelete is said to acheive a "triple-double" when they've scored more than 10 of each of the three stats (i.e, PTS, AST, REB) in a given game. 
        Triple doubles are a proxy casual fans use to measure an athlete's impact on a game and they've become a marker of game dominance and greatness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokić are the first and third leading earners of triple doubles in NBA history.
        Thus, the exploratory data analysis will start by analyzing these statistics over the course of their careers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following plots were created in data gathered from the NBA API at the "playercareerstats" endpoint. 
        The total data for Russell Westbrook's career stats from the aforementioned endpoint is shown below in a snippet of a pandas dataframe:
        
        <div <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/uncleaned_data_snippet.png" class="w3-image">
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because this section of the exploratory data analysis only strives to analyze data surrounding the triple-double, I've cleaned the datasets
        for each athlete to include only the following data.
        <div <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/cleaned_data_snippet.png" class="w3-image">
        </div>
        
        Note that
        <ul>
            <li>SEASON_ID refers to the year of the NBA season, which starts in the late summer and ends in late Spring of the following year.</li>
            <li>TEAM_ABBREVIATION denotes the city and team for which the athlete played. (e.g, LAC denotes the Los Angeles Clippers and DEN denotes Denver Nuggets).</li>
            <li>MIN denotes the total number of minutes an athlete played during that season.</li>
        </ul>
        
        Lastly, one item specifically cleaned involves the "TOT" in the 16th index of the uncleaned data at column "TEAM_ABBREIVATION". 
        This means that the athlete played for more than one team during that season. I've made the assumption that if this occurs in the dataset, 
        that TOT will be replaced to the team the player <it>started</it> the season with. Thus, TOT is changed to the value in at the previous index in the same column.

    <p>
    To assess if Jokić and Westbrook should be among the greatest NBA players of all time, I decided to grab the data of the all time leaders in scoring and assists. 
    I then grabbed the data of all active players of the NBA and removed from the data any player that was also in the stat leaders category. LeBron James and Russell Westbrook are notable for being in both groups.
    Next, I used only the top 20 players in the currently active (but not leading) dataset by minutes. This was done to ensure that the active players with the most minutes would
    be compared to the stat leaders, who were players with many years of longevity. Below, I've plotted a figure of assists versus points for both groups of athletes. K-means was then applied to determine if there were 
    clusters that separate the two populations. 
    
    Because the leaders population only contains data on the top 10 athletes in each statistic, I've chosen to only use the players in the top 95 percentile of minutes played in the leauge for comparison.
    A histogram shows the total minutes played in the career of all currently active NBA players NOT in the leader categories.
    </p>
    
    <div class="w3-center">
      <img src="./images/minutes_played_all_players.png" class="w3-image" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px;">
    </div>
    
    <p>
    Note that curve is falls exponentially as minutes increase. This implies that it becomes harder and harder for an athlete to continue their career as they age. Thus, there are still players with great longevity even if they
    haven't cracked the top 10 in assists or points. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Below is a labeled scatter plot of career assists versus career points for the two types of athletes - leaders and non-leaders. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="w3-center">
      <img src="images/pts_asts_scatter.png" class="w3-image" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px;">
    </div>
    <p>
    Note that it seems like there is a flaw in the data. The top most blue scatter point seems to among both the top 10 assists and points. Thus, it is perhaps true that the all time leaders endpoint that grabbed the leaders list for each stat
    is not as recently updated as the career player statistics endpoint that I used to grab the career stats. Besides this point, however, we can clearly see that the leaders are the top performers in points and assists by viewing the orange points 
    as being further along the x and y axes for their respective stats.
