<p>
The National Basketball Association is the second highest revenue sports league in the world. Moreover, the league has players representing a record 43 different countries. In fact, 
during the past five years, the athletes voted to win the most valuable player (MVP) represent Serbia, Cameroon, and Greece, respectively. With global reach and a diverse player base, the NBA
 produces entertainment that spans continents. Because analysts meticulously record player and game statistics, game data is ripe for hobbyist data scientists to explore the patterns of their 
 favorite players and teams. Analyzing this data may yield understanding to many facets of basketball, such as why some teams have greater success than others, or what types of plays a player can
 make to be most impactful. This analysis will start off by looking at the general life cycle of an NBA athlete and uncover league averages in contributions such as points, assists, and rebounds.
</p>

<p>
The analysis herein will focus mainly on what stats the most reputable athletes generate. Particularly, this analysis will look at two former MVPs, Nikola Jokic and Russell Westbrook, 
that currently play on the same team: the Denver Nuggets. Aged 30 and 36 respectively, the two athletes are at different points in their career trajectory, with the latter far beyond the
 average age of retirement for the NBA. However, both athletes have shown great success throughout their entire careers and we will examine what qualities of their play have led to such 
 great achievement. However, achievement was never guaranteed. And many fans, particularly for Russell Westbrook, were quick to decry his slumping contributions during the later half of his 
 career. Were these criticisms justified? Or were they frustrated pieces of gossip garnered on social media by fans of a losing team?
</p>

<p>
In addition, this project will look to explore a few broad areas of interest within the domain of basketball stats. The three large areas involved include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>How bench players, standard starters, and league stars statistically compare to each other</li>
    <li>How given subsets of athletes on the floor can indicate what type of play may occur</li>
    <li>Whether or not it is possible to determine the outcome of a game with just the in-game stats at halftime</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first point begs the question surrounding how we can compare bench players, starters, and stars. Every NBA team would be fortunate to have a single athlete that they would consider to be their 
star, or franchise player. Teams hope that this player can ascend to the ranks of those considered for the greatest of all time. However, many NBA athletes, even those considered stars, require a 
cohesive and competent supporting cast of teammates that elevate their abilities and provide the foundation on which a star can succeed. But is it possible that a fan’s notion of what makes an athlete 
a star is a fabricated division from the rest of the team? Or are athletes considered stars statistically part of a different population of basketball player?
</p>

<p>
Tabs in this analysis will discuss the difference between bench players and stars, and how much of their statistical difference can be attributed to their portion of the limited time playing. Moreover, 
we’ll explore how the greatest stat leaders in given categories like points and assists differ from athletes of similar time playing. This comparison may show how stars are performing relative to athletes 
that have been given comparable playing time by their coaches. Lastly, bench players allow stars to rest. Their role is largely to maintain the status of the basketball game before the starters return 
to the court. However, the same questions can be asked of the bench players—are they significantly different from other athletes that start? If not, there may be an argument to start providing more minutes 
to bench players that may be considered a better value relative to their contracts—especially if their in-game performance is similar enough to starting players.
</p>

<p>
The second big area of discussion involves how a given subset of athletes on the floor might predict the outcome of a certain play. For example, if Jokic and Westbrook are on the court and both involved 
with a play, are they more or less likely to score? Who are the athletes most likely to fumble a play? Understanding these contexts can help players and coaches understand their team and their opponents.
 By understanding what players have the best chemistry together, coaches can draw plays that highlight the duo's capabilities. If two players are found to perform poorly together, coaches can create 
 rotations in their lineup that limit the two’s time on the court together.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, correlations can be studied about how a given team's athletes respond to the presence of opponent athletes. If, for example, the main scorer on one team has a tough offensive match-up 
with a formidable defensive athlete of another team, it would be worthwhile to understand how subsets of athletes from both teams perform. This would allow coaches to focus on different players 
within their lineup given the statistically worse performance their main scorer produces in certain situations. It would also allow for coaches to run specific defensive plays; if the coach of the 
home team recognizes a lot of ball movement between players of the opposing team, they could predict that their offensive goal may be to score a layup. This situation, for example, would likely 
encourage tougher defense closer to their goal.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I’m curious if it is possible to predict the outcome of a game given the halftime stats. Many prediction models are made to predict the overall outcome of a game. These are used in sports 
betting apps and allow users to bet upon the outcome of a game up until the final few minutes. However, these advanced algorithms consider both historical information and in-game data in making their 
predictions. Historical information includes how well the team has done up until the present game in the season. Information here might involve overall season record (wins and losses), offensive and 
defensive ranking, or their season-long three-point percentage.
</p>

<p>
However, I’m interested in whether the outcome of a game can be predicted using only what’s happened in the first half. These stats reflect the number of field goals made, missed, or turnovers a team 
commits within just a single game. And rather than using final game totals, I’ll stop at halftime. That’s when coaches regroup, tweak their strategy, and deliver their locker room speeches. It makes the
prediction task a little more interesting—can we still predict what happens, even knowing that teams will often adjust in the second half? If so, it suggests that early-game performance carries enough signal 
to outweigh second-half variability. It might also reveal which teams are so dominant early that their wins are essentially locked in. Or, alternatively, it could highlight which metrics—like rebounding or turnovers—are the best indicators of momentum going into the second half. This kind of insight isn’t just useful for modeling; it could inform coaching decisions or even live betting strategies.
</p>


<p>
If successful, this would suggest that the best indicators of who will win may not come from full-season stats or betting lines, but from the real-time pace and performance of the game itself. It 
would also give fans and coaches alike a better sense of how “locked in” a team might be on a given night. The next sections of this project will dive into each of these three areas to better understand 
the nature of basketball performance, teamwork, and in-game decision-making.
</p>
<p>Examples of more questions that this analysis will address are:
</p>

    
<ul>
  <li>What does the statistical profile of an average NBA player look like in terms of points, assists, and career length?</li>
  <li>How do bench players compare to starters and stars when controlling for minutes played?</li>
  <li>Are there statistical indicators—such as age or performance decline—that can suggest when a player might retire?</li>
  <li>In what ways do Nikola Jokić and Russell Westbrook exceed league averages, and how has each player's career evolved over time?</li>
  <li>What specific metrics support why Jokic and Westbrook earned MVP honors?</li>
  <li>Have Jokic and Westbrook improved or changed since becoming teammates on the Denver Nuggets?</li>
  <li>Do some player combinations lead to more successful plays than others? Can we detect on-court chemistry through play-by-play data?</li>
  <li>How does player performance change when matched against specific defenders or opposing lineups?</li>
  <li>What does public sentiment data (from sources like news headlines) say about Jokic versus Westbrook, and how does that sentiment shift over time?</li>
  <li>Using only halftime in-game stats, is it possible to predict which team will win an NBA game?</li>
</ul>

    <p>
        <strong>One place to begin understanding NBA data,</strong> is to know the three main statistics that our two famed athletes are most famous for: points, rebounds and assists. 
        In the following figures, you'll see these statistics abbreviated to "PTS", "REB", and "AST", respectively.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Points occur when a player throws the ball into a basketball hoop. They can be scored in increments of one, two, or three.
            <li> Assits occur when a player passes the ball to another player, and the secondary player immediately moves to score. The assist is awarded to the first player.
            <li> Rebounds occur when a player grabs a ball that has just been thrown towards a basket and misses. They occur offensively, when a player catches the ball off of the opponent's goal, and defensively, when the ball is caught rebounding off the player's own goal.
        </ul>
    
    <p>
        An athelete is said to acheive a "triple-double" when they've scored more than 10 of each of the three stats (i.e, PTS, AST, REB) in a given game. 
        Triple doubles are a proxy casual fans use to measure an athlete's impact on a game and they've become a marker of game dominance and greatness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokić are the first and third leading earners of triple doubles in NBA history.
        Thus, the exploratory data analysis will start by analyzing these statistics over the course of their careers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following plots were created in data gathered from the NBA API at the "playercareerstats" endpoint. 
        The total data for Russell Westbrook's career stats from the aforementioned endpoint is shown below in a snippet of a pandas dataframe:
        
        <div <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/module1_images/uncleaned_data_snippet.png" class="w3-image">
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because this section of the exploratory data analysis only strives to analyze data surrounding the triple-double, I've cleaned the datasets
        for each athlete to include only the following data.
        <div <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/module1_images/cleaned_data_snippet.png" class="w3-image">
        </div>
        
        Note that
        <ul>
            <li>SEASON_ID refers to the year of the NBA season, which starts in the late summer and ends in late Spring of the following year.</li>
            <li>TEAM_ABBREVIATION denotes the city and team for which the athlete played. (e.g, LAC denotes the Los Angeles Clippers and DEN denotes Denver Nuggets).</li>
            <li>MIN denotes the total number of minutes an athlete played during that season.</li>
        </ul>
        
        Lastly, one item specifically cleaned involves the "TOT" in the 16th index of the uncleaned data at column "TEAM_ABBREIVATION". 
        This means that the athlete played for more than one team during that season. I've made the assumption that if this occurs in the dataset, 
        that TOT will be replaced to the team the player <it>started</it> the season with. Thus, TOT is changed to the value in at the previous index in the same column.
