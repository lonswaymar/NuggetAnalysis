    <p>Introduction and questions will need to be updated to reflect the nature of the analysis.</p>
    <p>1-3) How can we quantify the average NBA player? How many points do they score or assists do they make? How many years do they play?</p>
    <p>4-5) Are there performance indicators that suggest when a player will retire? What indicates a long career?</p>
    <p>6) How great are Jokic and Westbrook to the averages?</p>
    <p>7) In what ways are these two athletes the greatest and why did they deserve MVP nomination?
    <p>8) Have they elevated each others game? How is Russ in Denver?</p>
    <p>9) What is the news sentiment around each player? Do they differ in positivity?</p>
    <p>10) and lastly... is there any possible way to predict the outcome of a game?</p>

    <p>
        <strong>One place to begin understanding NBA data,</strong> is to know the three main statistics that our two famed athletes are most famous for: points, rebounds and assists. 
        In the following figures, you'll see these statistics abbreviated to "PTS", "REB", and "AST", respectively.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Points occur when a player throws the ball into a basketball hoop. They can be scored in increments of one, two, or three.
            <li> Assits occur when a player passes the ball to another player, and the secondary player immediately moves to score. The assist is awarded to the first player.
            <li> Rebounds occur when a player grabs a ball that has just been thrown towards a basket and misses. They occur offensively, when a player catches the ball off of the opponent's goal, and defensively, when the ball is caught rebounding off the player's own goal.
        </ul>
    
    <p>
        An athelete is said to acheive a "triple-double" when they've scored more than 10 of each of the three stats (i.e, PTS, AST, REB) in a given game. 
        Triple doubles are a proxy casual fans use to measure an athlete's impact on a game and they've become a marker of game dominance and greatness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokić are the first and third leading earners of triple doubles in NBA history.
        Thus, the exploratory data analysis will start by analyzing these statistics over the course of their careers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following plots were created in data gathered from the NBA API at the "playercareerstats" endpoint. 
        The total data for Russell Westbrook's career stats from the aforementioned endpoint is shown below in a snippet of a pandas dataframe:
        
        <div <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/module1_images/uncleaned_data_snippet.png" class="w3-image">
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because this section of the exploratory data analysis only strives to analyze data surrounding the triple-double, I've cleaned the datasets
        for each athlete to include only the following data.
        <div <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/module1_images/cleaned_data_snippet.png" class="w3-image">
        </div>
        
        Note that
        <ul>
            <li>SEASON_ID refers to the year of the NBA season, which starts in the late summer and ends in late Spring of the following year.</li>
            <li>TEAM_ABBREVIATION denotes the city and team for which the athlete played. (e.g, LAC denotes the Los Angeles Clippers and DEN denotes Denver Nuggets).</li>
            <li>MIN denotes the total number of minutes an athlete played during that season.</li>
        </ul>
        
        Lastly, one item specifically cleaned involves the "TOT" in the 16th index of the uncleaned data at column "TEAM_ABBREIVATION". 
        This means that the athlete played for more than one team during that season. I've made the assumption that if this occurs in the dataset, 
        that TOT will be replaced to the team the player <it>started</it> the season with. Thus, TOT is changed to the value in at the previous index in the same column.
