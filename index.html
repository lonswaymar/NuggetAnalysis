    <p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the second highest revenue sports league in the world and a global powerhouse of entertainment. With players representing a record 43 countries, the league’s reach spans continents, cultures, and fan bases. Its biggest stars—like Nikola Jokić, Joel Embiid, and Giannis Antetokounmpo—hail from Serbia, Cameroon, and Greece, respectively, highlighting just how international the sport has become. As the league grows more competitive and global, so does interest in understanding the deeper dynamics that drive team success and individual excellence. Fans and analysts alike want to know what makes great players stand out, what factors determine a team’s ability to win, and how careers evolve over time. This analysis explores these questions through the lens of performance data, focusing on the statistical signatures of player impact, team advantage, and long-term success. With every dribble, shot, rebound, and turnover recorded in great detail, basketball becomes a rich and revealing subject of study.</p>
    <p>The project begins by exploring the lifecycle of a professional athlete and how their contributions change over time. One focus is the contrast between starters and bench players—how their stats differ across categories like scoring, passing, and rebounding, and what this might suggest about their roles and longevity. As fans, we often hear that some players "fade" after a certain age or "peak" early, but does the data support these narratives? Are career arcs different for high-usage players versus role players? Can we group players by their statistical fingerprints and discover shared patterns in how they develop or decline? These kinds of questions are not only useful for understanding individual careers—they also shed light on how teams are built and where value is found across a roster. In short, player performance isn’t just about raw talent. It’s about context, timing, and how each role fits into the larger strategy of the game. </p>
    <p>Zooming in from the big-picture view, this project also takes a closer look at two former MVPs: Nikola Jokić and Russell Westbrook. Despite sharing a team late in their careers, their paths and play styles couldn’t be more different. Jokić, known for his versatility and efficiency, has become the model of a modern big man. Westbrook, once celebrated for his relentless energy and triple-double dominance, now faces scrutiny from fans who question his current impact. Are those criticisms fair? What kinds of contributions is he still making, and how do they compare to his earlier years—or to other players at similar stages in their careers? Exploring questions like these helps paint a more complete picture of value in basketball. It also raises deeper questions about how fans perceive greatness, how much of a player’s reputation is shaped by numbers versus narrative, and whether there are overlooked ways to measure impact on the court.</p>
    <p>Finally, the analysis explores the dynamics of team-level performance. What kinds of in-game moments tip the scale toward winning? Can key plays—like a block, a rebound, or a substitution—shift momentum enough to influence the outcome? By tracking the types of events that occur in real time, we can begin to understand what separates successful possessions from missed opportunities. This approach opens the door to analyzing how strategy unfolds not over an entire season, but over the course of a single game. For example, are there certain actions that consistently happen before a made basket, or events that lead to a swing in score margin? This type of exploration doesn’t just explain what happened—it hints at why. In a sport where the pace is fast and the margins thin, even the smallest patterns can reveal something meaningful. And those patterns are exactly what this project sets out to find.

    <p>1-3) How can we quantify the average NBA player? How many points do they score or assists do they make? How many years do they play?</p>
    <p>4-5) Are there performance indicators that suggest when a player will retire? What indicates a long career?</p>
    <p>6) How great are Jokic and Westbrook to the averages?</p>
    <p>7) In what ways are these two athletes the greatest and why did they deserve MVP nomination?
    <p>8) Have they elevated each others game? How is Russ in Denver?</p>

    <p>
        <strong>One place to begin understanding NBA data,</strong> is to know the three main statistics that our two famed athletes are most famous for: points, rebounds and assists. 
        In the following figures, you'll see these statistics abbreviated to "PTS", "REB", and "AST", respectively.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Points occur when a player throws the ball into a basketball hoop. They can be scored in increments of one, two, or three.
            <li> Assits occur when a player passes the ball to another player, and the secondary player immediately moves to score. The assist is awarded to the first player.
            <li> Rebounds occur when a player grabs a ball that has just been thrown towards a basket and misses. They occur offensively, when a player catches the ball off of the opponent's goal, and defensively, when the ball is caught rebounding off the player's own goal.
        </ul>
    
    <p>
        An athelete is said to acheive a "triple-double" when they've scored more than 10 of each of the three stats (i.e, PTS, AST, REB) in a given game. 
        Triple doubles are a proxy casual fans use to measure an athlete's impact on a game and they've become a marker of game dominance and greatness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokić are the first and third leading earners of triple doubles in NBA history.
        Thus, the exploratory data analysis will start by analyzing these statistics over the course of their careers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following plots were created in data gathered from the NBA API at the "playercareerstats" endpoint. 
        The total data for Russell Westbrook's career stats from the aforementioned endpoint is shown below in a snippet of a pandas dataframe:
        
        <div <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/module1_images/uncleaned_data_snippet.png" class="w3-image">
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because this section of the exploratory data analysis only strives to analyze data surrounding the triple-double, I've cleaned the datasets
        for each athlete to include only the following data.
        <div <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/module1_images/cleaned_data_snippet.png" class="w3-image">
        </div>
        
        Note that
        <ul>
            <li>SEASON_ID refers to the year of the NBA season, which starts in the late summer and ends in late Spring of the following year.</li>
            <li>TEAM_ABBREVIATION denotes the city and team for which the athlete played. (e.g, LAC denotes the Los Angeles Clippers and DEN denotes Denver Nuggets).</li>
            <li>MIN denotes the total number of minutes an athlete played during that season.</li>
        </ul>
        
        Lastly, one item specifically cleaned involves the "TOT" in the 16th index of the uncleaned data at column "TEAM_ABBREIVATION". 
        This means that the athlete played for more than one team during that season. I've made the assumption that if this occurs in the dataset, 
        that TOT will be replaced to the team the player <it>started</it> the season with. Thus, TOT is changed to the value in at the previous index in the same column.
