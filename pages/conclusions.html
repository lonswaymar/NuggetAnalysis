            <p>
            Looking back, the main goal here was to dig into NBA data with the hope that something meaningful would fall out — and I think it did. From comparing MVPs to bench players, to predicting game outcomes at halftime, this project tried to bridge casual basketball interest with exploratory data analysis. A little stats, a little curiosity, and a lot of scraped play-by-play.
            </p>

            <p>
            The exploration around player roles really opened my eyes. I used to think the "starter vs. bench" label was mostly about coaching politics or contract size. But it turns out, the actual per-minute production of many so-called bench players isn’t that far off from their starter counterparts. When you normalize by play time, some players look wildly underutilized — and that’s something teams might want to think more about.
            </p>

            <p>
            The player chemistry section was also fascinating. You always hear fans saying things like, “Jokic and Gordon have great synergy,” but it was cool to actually see some of that show up in the data. Not every combination of players performs the same, and you can sometimes spot when a team is just more cohesive with certain lineups. That kind of stuff could be huge in game planning.
            </p>

            <p>
            Predicting outcomes at halftime was the boldest question I tried to tackle — and surprisingly, it wasn’t total chaos. Even without full-game data, some patterns showed up. Turnovers, rebounding margins, and shot efficiency by halftime really did tell a story. I’m not building a sports betting app any time soon, but there’s something here. Coaches probably already know this intuitively — but it's fun to see the math nod in agreement.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
            Ultimately, the stats made me respect the game even more. There’s an elegance in how roles are defined, how momentum builds, and how even the smallest shifts in performance can change outcomes. Westbrook’s late-career form? Maybe not as bad as Twitter thinks. Jokic’s dominance? Definitely not overhyped. This project helped me separate fan noise from on-court patterns.
            </p>

            <p>
            No model is perfect. But sometimes it doesn’t have to be. Sometimes it’s enough to look closer, ask better questions, and enjoy the process. Whether it’s finding hidden value in underplayed athletes or showing that halftime stats actually matter — this project was worth the work.
            </p>

            <p>
            So if you’ve ever wondered what machine learning can say about basketball, or just wanted a better excuse to binge NBA stats late at night, I hope this gave you something to think about. And if not... well, at least it was fun.
