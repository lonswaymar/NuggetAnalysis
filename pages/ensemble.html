            <h6><strong>Overview</strong></h6>
            <p>
            Ensemble learning combines the predictions of many individual models to produce a result that's more accurate than any one of those models alone. Instead of trusting a single model 
            to get everything right, an ensemble relies on the collective trends to make better decisions. This idea plays out in a few main ways, each of which uses multiple models in a 
            slightly different way.
            </p>

            

            <p>
            The three most common ensemble techniques are <strong>bagging</strong>, <strong>boosting</strong>, and <strong>stacking</strong>. 
            Bagging creates many versions of a model by randomly sampling the data (with replacement) and training each version independently. Random forest is an example of 
            bagging since it uses many decision trees. I'll expand on this one further below. 
            Boosting, oppositely, trains models sequentially — each new model focuses on correcting the errors of the one before it. 
            Lastly, stacking takes a collection of models and trains a final model on their outputs to make the final prediction. All three approaches 
            aim to improve accuracy.

            <p>
            The ensemble method I used here is the <strong>Random Forest</strong>, which is based on <strong>bagging</strong> as I said above. 
            It builds many decision trees, each trained on a different random subset of the training data and features. 
            At prediction time, the test vector goes through all of the trees. The final prediction is the mode of the outcomes of all the trees. Often times, people refer to this
            as "voting".
            The goal is for random forests to reduce overfitting. It should help smooth out the inconsistencies of any single decision tree.
            </p>

            <p>
            Later on this page, you can see that I used a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a basketball team would win or lose a game based on their halftime statistics. 
            While a single decision tree might latch onto a few unhelpful features or noisy trends, a full forest helps mitigate that by 
            averaging across many trees! But for now, here is information on the data used in this analysis.
            </p>


            <!-- Dataset -->
            <h6 class="w3-margin-top"><strong>Dataset</strong></h6>
            <p>The dataset for this tab was uniquely constructed using two endpoints from the NBA API. The first endpoint, <code>LeagueGameLog</code>, allowed me to get the 
            win/loss labels for every game in the 2023-2024 season. A snippet from this endpoint is shown below.

            <p>To get the final cleaned dataset, I iterated through all of the game ID's present in the first dataset and summed up all of the instances of certain stats in the <code>PlayByPlay</code>
            for each team participating in each game. In doing this, I was able to get the half-time stats and the eventual outcome (win or lose) of each team for every game in the 2023-2024 season. 
            At this point, I also included some feature engineering. Instead of simply tracking the absolute value of <code>FIELD_GOALS_MADE</code>, for a given team, I also calculated the difference
            between in each stat for both teams. If, for example, team A had 15 field goals made and the other team had 12 field goals made, then the feature engineered <code>FIELD_GOALS_MADE_DIFF</code>
            column would report 3 and -3 for team A and B respectively. The final cleaned dataframe is shown below.

            <p>Note that the table above shows the complete cleaned and labeled dataset that forms the basis of all the other models in this tab and the subsequent two. 
            The labels were removed for all of the modeling. And the models were trained with 80% of the data and tested on the remainder. 
            </p>
            <h6><strong>Train Test Split</strong></h6>
            <p>Splitting the data into a training and testing portion is paramount. The model mustn't be tested 
            with data that it's already seen. This helps ensure the model isn't simply recognizing the same exact patterns it was trained on. Rather, it can now generalize to data beyond the training set.
            An analogy is that student's shouldn't be tested over the problems they solved in their homework but rather, be tested upon different types of problems within the same subject domain.
            I've shown the testing and training portions of the PCA transformed data below:

            <h6 class="w3-margin-top"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h6>
            <p>
            In this case, the forest achieved an accuracy of 70% on the test data, outperforming every standalone tree I tested during the Decision Tree tab! 
            This suggests that the model successfully generalized 
            to patterns that hold across games, rather than just memorizing the training examples. It’s a good reminder that while simple models can sometimes get close, 
            aggregating multiple weaker models can lead to stronger, more stable performance.
            </p>

            <p>
            For a non-technical takeaway: imagine asking 100 basketball fans to guess the outcome of a game using stats from the first half. Some fans might guess wildly, 
            but if you take a vote, the majority often gets it right. In this goofy analogy, each “fan” (tree) contributes a prediction, and the final decision reflects the consensus 
            of the 100 fans. In this case, the group did pretty well -- 70 fans predicted the correct outcome.
            </p>
