                <p><strong>PCA</strong> is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps simplify complex, high-dimensional data into a smaller number of components while preserving as much variation as possible.</p>
                <p>In this analysis, we apply PCA to NBA player stats from the <code>leaguedashplayerstats</code> endpoint to understand how players group by performance style.</p>

                <p>The raw data from the <code>leaguedashplayerstats</code> endpoint looks like this.</p>

                <p>At this step, I've added one feature only: STARTER. I created this feature by dividing the columns MIN/GP and masking the values above 25 minutes/game to be True. This division divides a players total season minutes played by total games played. 
                This will help us see clusters in the following PCA analysis below. My goal was to determine if a starting athlete in the basketball lineup produces significantly different stats compared to players that come off the bench.
                I had to create the STARTER label because athletes are not officially designated starters; this can vary game-to-game. Because games are 48 minutes long, most starters end up playing over half of the total game. That is why I chose the 25 minutes/game played threshold.
                </p>
                <p>However, MANY of the features in the original data are either qualitative, like TEAM_ABBREVIATION or PLAYER_NAME, or ordinal, like AGE or any feature ending in RANK, which describes an athletes rank over the season for that stat. For example, an athlete with 4 listed under AST would be the individual with the 4th most assists for that year.
                Removing these features, I was left with the following cleaned data:

                <p>Having addressed the data from the <code>leaguedashplayerstats</code> endpoint and how it was cleaned for PCA, we can now look at a 2 and 3 component decomposition of the entire 
                dataset. The figure below shows principal component (PC) two plotted by PC one. I've then used the <code>STARTER</code> to label the data. Notice that the bench players form a cluster 
                towards the left side of the figure. Some bench players and most of the starters fan out righward from the grey cluster. 
                </p>

                <div class="w3-center">
                    <img src="../images/module2_images/pca2.png" class="w3-image" style="width:100%; max-width:1000px;">
                </div>
                
                <p>The 2 component decomposition retains about 73% of the original variance in the data. The 3 component decomposition, shown on a 3D axis below, retains an additional 6% of the variance,
                pushing the total variance retained to about 79%.</p>

                <div class="w3-center">
                    <img src="../images/module2_images/pca3.png" class="w3-image" style="width:100%; max-width:1000px;">
                </div>
                
                <p>The 3D image shows that a curvature appears in the data when adding the third component. Notably, the cluster of grey points associated with bench players still remains and the fan of data following 
                the starters fans out along the curvature.
                </p>
                
                <p>So far the principal component analysis yields a cluster with a spread of data moving away from it. However, there's still variance from the original dataset to be captured. We can see how each subsequent 
                component captures less variance than the previous from this scree plot.
                </p>
                
                <div class="w3-center">
                    <img src="../images/module2_images/screeplot.png" class="w3-image" style="width:100%; max-width:1000px;">
                </div>
                
                <p>Furthermore, if we wanted to show how many principal components would be required to attain 95% of the total variance in the original data, we can iteratively add components to the decomposition and extract
                the total variance for each analysis. 
                The following image shows a line marking 95% of the total variance on the y-axis. We can see that the data shown in blue belong to the analyses where over 95% of the data's variance was captured. 
                <strong>To capture more than 95% of the data, greater than nine principal components are required</strong>, as indicated by the vertical line intersecting with the data and 95% threshold.
                </p>
                
                <div class="w3-center">
                    <img src="../images/module2_images/variance95.png" class="w3-image" style="width:100%; max-width:1000px;">
                </div>
                
                <p>We can see that every subsequent point contributes less variance to the decomposition than the previous. This is exceptionally noteworthy beyond the 9th principal component, where the
                explained variance asymptotically approaches 100%.
                </p> 
                <p>
                Overall, the 3 eigenvalues that describe the 3D plot are shown in this snippet:
                </p>
                
                <div class="w3-center">
                    <img src="../images/module2_images/eigenvalues.png" class="w3-image" style="width:50%; max-width:1000px;">
                </div>
                
                <p>The main takeaway so far from the principal componenet analysis is that bench players are associated with the only cluster and that 
                starters represent a fan of data moving outward with greater variance from the cluster. Given the features used in the decomposition, we can makes
                sense of the greater starter variance by their nature of simply playing more minutes. If a player has been given more minutes, they're likely to rack
                up more statistics in every other category. Thus, many of their accumulated stats track directly with minutes. Given more opportunity to play, starters
                <em>do more things</em> on the basketball court than bench players. To account for this, I've applied PCA once more; this time, however, I've divided many
                of the features in the cleaned dataset by the <code>MIN</code> column from the original dataframe. The results are shown next:
                </p>
                
                <div class="w3-center">
                    <img src="../images/module2_images/pca_min_scaled.png" class="w3-image" style="width:90%; max-width:1000px;">
                </div>
                
                <p>
                Notice how the two populations greatly overlap! <strong>If we accept my definition of <code>STARTER</code> to be appropriate</strong>,
                then we can conclude that there are many athletes in each population that could truly belong to other based on their per minute accumulation of
                the stats used in the analysis. 
                </p>
                <p>One real-world application of this analysis would be for a coach and team management to assess where their starters belong in this distribution.
                Perhaps, if their starter is in the middle of the distribution, they might have bench players that could perform at the same rate if their endurance to player extended minutes
                scaled with minutes played. This would allow starters to rest more throughout the season, expose more players to longer play times boosting their careers, and help
                teams stay below salary caps by playing lesser known players that still have deep talent and potential.
