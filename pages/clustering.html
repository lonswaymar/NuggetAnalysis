      <p>
        To assess if Jokić and Westbrook should be among the greatest NBA players of all time, I gathered data on all-time leaders in scoring and assists, then compared them to the top 20 currently active players (by minutes played) who are not on the leaderboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        This comparison helps determine whether a statistical difference exists between long-tenured high performers and current high-usage players. A histogram below shows the total career minutes played by all active players not on the leaderboards.

      </div>

      <p>
        Note the exponential drop-off in minutes — it's increasingly difficult to sustain a long NBA career. Yet, there are still many productive players who haven’t cracked the top 10 in points or assists.
      </p>

        Below is a labeled scatter plot of total career assists versus total career points for both groups of athletes.

        The orange dots represent leaderboard players, while blue dots represent high-minute active players. The visible separation suggests statistical differences — but does KMeans clustering agree?
      </p>

      <p>
        KMeans clustering works by initializing <i>k</i> centroids, assigning each point to the nearest one, then updating the centroids until convergence. Below are the results for this dataset:

      <div class="w3-center">
        <img src="../images/module2_images/kmeans.png" class="w3-image" style="width:70%;">
      </div>

      <p>
        Interestingly, the KMeans algorithm does not cleanly separate leaderboard players from others. This suggests that longevity (measured by minutes) — not intrinsic ability — is the main divider. Given enough time, high-minute players are likely to join the leaderboard ranks.
